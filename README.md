## How to use

Tasks are created using normal markdown syntax, for example `- [ ] Water the
plants`. Once a task is created, configure repetition or move the task using
the commands added by this plugin. This is easiest to do by either binding
them to a hotkey, or using the command palette.

Repetition configs can also be edited manually, however using the interface
helps ensure a valid repetition config has been created.

Tasks can also be moved to another day, and the original task and the moved
task will link bidirectionally.
